								<p>As a Junior data analyst, my primary objective is to provide insights and make data-driven decisions for organizations. I possess a strong set of skills in programming languages such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and Python, as well as expertise in data visualization tools like Tableau, Advanced Excel(Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, VLOOKUP) and Power BI. My background in data wrangling and analysis, as well as my education in statistics and SQL, have equipped me with the necessary skills to tackle any data-related challenge. I am a results-oriented individual with excellent communication and problem-solving skills. My experience as a data analyst intern and data entry clerk intern has provided me with hands-on experience in the field, and I am always eager to learn more. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Math and Computer Science and have completed certifications such as Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and Nano-degree ALX-T Data analysis. I am excited to showcase my abilities in a growing company and help them effectively utilize their data to make informed decisions.</p>
